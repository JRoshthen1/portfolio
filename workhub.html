                    WorkHub is the latest project that me and my group of classmates are working on.
                    I will not be able to provide a link to the website or to the webapp from here because this project
                    is still in the "build phase".
                    On the end of this page, I am including a school report with my journey and feelings through this
                    project.

            <h3>Report of my journey</h3>
            <br>
            <p>First day after summer, we received an assignment with the first showcase of
                generating ideas for the next 7 weeks, which sounded a lot easier than it actually was. These brainstorm
                sessions were very scary because we had very little time to think of all the variables in business, thus
                generate a good idea that we will enjoy building for quite some time. We all had super different ideas
                and a lot of them were very good ones but through some research and finding what are some of the 2021
                problems we figured out that we could help people find just some simple work or make some quick money
                with their skills.<br>
                Finding people for discussing this kind of problem with was very easy. So many people are still
                suffering from the pandemic or just want to make some money, so the incentive of using our product
                exists. We mostly focused on social media posts and analyzed them for the intelligence of what people
                are looking for, how they are searching for it and what platforms are they using.
                Creating personas was a really interesting process in this assignment because we had so many building
                blocks that we could use to get it just right, but sometimes too much information can be difficult to
                handle.<br>
                Competitive analysis was also very important for designing our product and making it user-friendly. Our
                main competitor was a platform called Workee, on which we made SWOT analysis.
                <br>For technologies, we stuck with the good old Bootstrap to strap everything
                together. Firebase is a very interesting piece of software for many reasons. For us, the main reason was
                the pricing and Google connection.
                Because Firebase is made by Google it was easy hooking up Google sign-in and accessing the
                Authentication database. But most of our problems came with communicating with other databases. I was
                very confused about the terminology such as “keys, mount, async, and await...” from watching all the
                tutorials. They gave me all the tools I required but without understanding them in-depth, it was
                impossi-
                ble to implement them.<br>
                Testing our prototypes was very fun in this project, unlike some other ones. We really tried to build
                something that helps people so people were happy to test it and point out a lot of stuff that we would
                surely miss.
                My overall conclusion is that I really enjoyed working on something that is ours, has a business plan
                that we can personalize, and is a great group to work with!
                I learned a lot of new things in this project from handling large amounts of data to coding in a couple
                of new frameworks. Every step of this project taught me to look at things from a different perspective
                which I am really grateful for.</p>
